OpenDraft is an open-source 2D CAD project that aims to provide a lightweight, user-friendly, and extendable CAD solution. The project is currently in its early stages of development, focusing on setting up the program structure and core classes.  

## Features

The following features have now been implemented: TBC

## Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines the planned features for OpenDraft:

1. **Basic drawing tools (lines, circles, rectangles, etc.)**: Implement essential drawing tools to create geometric shapes and objects, rendered via Avalonia.  
2. **Layer management**: Organize and control visibility and editing of different elements within drawings.  
3. **Snap and grid functionality**: Enable precise alignment of objects based on predefined increments.  
4. **Object selection and manipulation**: Select and modify objects, including moving, scaling, rotating, and editing attributes.  
5. **Undo/Redo functionality**: Allow users to undo and redo actions for flexible experimentation.  
6. **Export to common file formats (DXF, SVG, etc.)**: Ensure compatibility with other CAD software.  
7. **Customizable user interface**: Arrange tools, panels, and menus for a personalized workspace.  
8. **Plugin system for extending functionality**: Allow third-party tools and features to enhance OpenDraft.  
9. **Extensive block library**: Include common engineering components such as fastenings, piping, electrical, etc.  

*This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and evolving project priorities.*

## Dependencies

OpenDraft currently depends on:

- [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) â€” Cross-platform .NET UI framework for rendering and window management

## Why Another CAD Package?

While there are existing open-source CAD solutions such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, OpenDraft aims to offer a distinct approach:

- **Lightweight**: Focuses on minimal resource usage while maintaining essential functionality.  
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface designed for users of all experience levels.  
- **Extendable**: Plugin system allows users to customize and enhance functionality.  
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Avalonia to leverage a modern, cross-platform UI framework.  
- **Free Forever**: Open-source and community-driven, providing professional-grade CAD functionality at no cost.
